# [Fabric] Corvus Provenance
- A Fabric Modpack featuring Origins, and various RPG mods to make your experience feel closer to an MMO.

## Welcome to Corvus Provenance
- This is a modpack designed to get yourself into the mood of playing an RPG-esque version of minecraft!
- We hope to provide an experience that works well in a multiplayer setting, almost like setting up an MMO/MMORPG with the convinence of minecraft.
- While there's a lot of work to still go on this pack, this candidate we felt was our best idea for release, so we can go into some details

## Details
- Step into a new world, one where the landmasses are indeed massive - created via Starmute's Continents and Terralith mods. Delicately interlacing new biomes, and various features, you'll find no shortage of exploration above ground. With new animals provided by Naturalist, Duckling, and Better Animals Plus (with many more mods adding more animals - including fish!) we've got a lot of new ways to accumulate resources, and tame various beasts. Bounties, Quests - and more professions for our villagers provide a much more indepth look into what could be, especially when you consider the additional villager roles, let alone the sheer size and location of new villages. As we said before, we aim to provide a robust, and expansive overworld so we can then impress you with what's coming up from below.  
- We also have new areas underground. Large expansive biomes such as Mossy underground forests provided with various glowing lichens, as well as new ways to explore skulk - of course with a few new enemies and mobs to sort through. And let's not forget, various origins will have an easier time beneath the ground, as well as within the ocean.
- With an amplified nether, the roof is doubled - and you'll have quite the extensive adventure in the hellish depths. Provided with new, powerful mobs (and some peaceful ones of course) - you'll be able to launch a full exploration party into the various villages and depths within - while maintaining the challenge provided by your various origins, skills, and roles - trying to get out. New ores, new tools, and various treasures await you as you find new places to descend. Incendium, Cinderscapes, and other mods provide new areas, buildings, constructs, and monsters both in and out of the lava pools - and moldy forests. 
- The End has been revamped as well, with new biomes, structures, and villages by Nullscape, and Better End. Stare down into the void like never before, and experience yourself as you explore the isles - with great caution, intrigue, and suspense. While the information here may be lacking, that isn't to say the end itself is lacking, rather there's a lot more at stake, and with Biome's O'plenty, and Enderscape added into the mix, you'll be able to launch yourself into the full exploration. 
- We have various structure mods that allow for more natural based structures, dungeons, villages, and other areas to spawn in all dimensions. This should help players feel a bit more welcomed, and charm that sense of adventure. We also have added weapons from other minecraft based games - allowing you to utilize the full potential of your roles, origins, and stats. 
- To add this, we've added various leveling systems, and stats mods. LevelZ, Professions, PlayerEx, and others help to provide some of the more familiar systems we've come to know and love from other games, while keeping things fair, balanced, and expanding on the potential for an almost true RP like experience. Eventually we aim to migrate to have roles divided out according to stats to enforce this, but for now, we can just play around and get used to everything above.
- We have built in shader support with Iris Shaders, and various features for resource packs provided by other visual mods that allow you to animate textures, fix models, etc. We also have dark mode enabled by default, along with legendary tooltips, and other mods. 
- And finally, we've done our best to maximize performance, and reliability/stability - this will always be a work in progress, but with the various performance mods like ferritecore, servercore, krypton, lithium, and sodium, we aim to provide a more optimized experience for players with medium-end pcs. While the pack has been tested within RAM constrained environments, of course we would continue to recommend 8+GB dedicated for small servers, and single player clients.
